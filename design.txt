# Metadata of record,relation and page 

struct RecordHeader {
    int recordID;
    int offset;
}; 

struct PageHeader {
    int pageNumber;
    int recordCount;
};

struct FileHeader {
    int numberOfPages;
    char typeName[12]; #Because relation names' length limit is 12
};


# Limitations 

Each relation has a folder with the same name, in that folder we have 

* index.py # for index structure 

* page0.txt-page9.txt #initially each relation have 10 pages in their file with each page storing 10 records.

* each folder initially have 1 page but it is of varying length with respect to need. 

* relations have at most 10 fields each field name is of 20 chars length. 

* relation names up to 12 chars length is supported.
